# Typing Test Website

Welcome to the Typing Test website! This application allows users to test and improve their typing speed and accuracy. The test is designed with various features to provide a comprehensive typing experience, including live tracking of typing accuracy, words per minute (WPM), key count, and more.

## Features

### 1. **Typing Accuracy**
   - The application calculates and displays your typing accuracy in real-time as you type. This helps you understand how many characters you have typed correctly versus the total number of characters.

### 2. **Words Per Minute (WPM)**
   - The website tracks and displays your typing speed in words per minute (WPM). This is calculated based on the number of words you type correctly within the given time.

### 3. **Timing**
   - The typing test has a fixed duration of 2 minutes and 30 seconds (2:30). The timer starts as soon as you begin typing, and the remaining time is displayed throughout the test.

### 4. **Key Count**
   - The total number of keys pressed during the typing session is tracked and displayed. This includes all keystrokes, whether correct or incorrect.

### 5. **Correct Word Count**
   - The application also keeps track of the number of correctly typed words. This count is updated live as you continue typing, helping you monitor your performance.

### 6. **High Score**
   - Your highest WPM score is saved and displayed as your high score. This allows you to challenge yourself and try to beat your previous best performance.

### 7. **Reset Button**
   - A reset button is provided to allow you to restart the typing test at any time. This will reset all metrics, including the timer, accuracy, WPM, key count, and correct word count.

## How It Works

1. **Start Typing**: The test begins as soon as you start typing. The timer will start counting down from 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

2. **Live Tracking**: As you type, the website tracks and displays your WPM, accuracy, key count, and correct word count in real-time.

3. **Finish the Test**: When the timer runs out, the final results will be displayed, including your WPM, accuracy, total key count, and the number of correct words typed.

4. **Reset**: You can use the reset button to start a new typing test at any time.
